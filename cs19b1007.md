# MINI ASSIGNMENT 2 : LARGE CODE BASES AND OOP
Clang is a compiler front end for the C , C++ , Objective C and Objective C++ programming languages. It uses the LLVM compiler infrastructure at its back end. It was actually designed to act as a drop-in replacement for GNU compiler collection or GCC. It is also a open source software. It is only used for the compilation of C like languages while for other languages GCC is used.        
## C++11/C++14 features used          
With the constant requirements in the software, the main features introduced with the modern C++ like C++11, C++14
like Lambda calculus , Move semantics , STL additions , General libraries like std::chrono which is used for date and time utilities.         
So with these new features added in C++ using Clang is more suited because it can perform static analysis which is when obvious bugs are automatically detected such as dead code, memory leaks, bad pointer references        
Also Clang lets you write tools that give you information about a program. There are three ways to do this:

Using LibCLang, a high-level C interface to Clang. This lets you access Clang from languages other than C++, as well as walk through the AST using a cursor.       
(AST is short for Abstract syntax tree, and is the output of the front end before generating the LLVM IR code that is used by the backend)           
You can write plugins for Clang to modify the compile process.         
The third way is to use LibTooling, a C++ interface that lets you write standalone tools      
Any version of Clang 3.3 and above support any feature that was added as new in C++11 which is same as a GCC 4.3 version       
and Clang 3.4 version would support features added in C++14 same as a GCC 4.9 version.        
When it comes to speed GCC would prevail but Clang is getting better release by release so this would be good for a long term.       
In C++ the namespaces are also used to modularize the code base which is also used by the LLVM/clang         
In C++11 enum classes are introduced which implicitly scope the enum values within the enum’s name. So this way we could guarantee that two distinct enums don’t both called with the same name.        
Also C++ is not just only OOP but it is also Procedural Programming, OOP and generic programming. So the LLVM/ CLang source code mix between the three paradigms     

## Class Hierarchy

* _Parse Symbol Page
* bool
* char
* constant
* datetime
* float
* init
* int
* deque
* list
* queue
* signal
* threads
* vector

## OOP design decisions for LLVM
In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a way to establish Is-a relationship between objects. It is often confused as a way to reuse the existing code which is not a good practice because inheritance for implementation reuse leads to Tight Coupling. Re-usability of code is achieved through composition (Composition over inheritance).
There is also the case of Multiple inheritence in which classes inherit from multiple concrete classes. The OOP paradigm is widely used in the llvm/clang source code.         


## Design Patterns
- General techniques which could be changed at run time
- Singleton : Is a creational design pattern where there is only a single instance of a class and client code is forbidden from creating new instances.
- Factory methods : allows instatiating classes from a class hierarchy without hardcoding the class name and knowing the class implementation. There are many variations of this design pattern, however the most common form is a class with method which returns an instance of a derived class based on some input such as a number, code, class name as string or number.

## Usage of Iterators and their own data structures
Iteration over the preprocessed entities.

In a complete iteration, the iterator walks the range [-M, N), where negative values are used to indicate preprocessed entities loaded from the external source while non-negative values are used to indicate preprocessed entities introduced by the current preprocessor. However, to provide iteration in source order (for, e.g., chained precompiled headers), dereferencing the iterator flips the negative values (corresponding to loaded entities), so that position -M corresponds to element 0 in the loaded entities vector, position -M+1 corresponds to element 1 in the loaded entities vector, etc. This gives us a reasonably efficient, source-order walk.

The LLVM compiler infrastructure have many different data structures that may be traversed. Following the example of the C++ standard template library, the techniques used to traverse these various data structures are all basically the same. For a enumerable sequence of values, the XXXbegin() function (or method) returns an iterator to the start of the sequence, the XXXend() function returns an iterator pointing to one past the last valid element of the sequence, and there is some XXXiterator data type that is common between the two operations.
Because the pattern for iteration is common across many different aspects of the program representation, the standard template library algorithms may be used on them, and it is easier to remember how to iterate.
